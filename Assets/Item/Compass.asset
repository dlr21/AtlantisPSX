  description: This item is acquired in Level 1 and may be used by any character. 
    It tells the direction you are facing; however, it isn't much use in this walkthrough
    because I never make mention to those trivial, yet helpful direction labels like
    "south" and "north."  Live and learn, I guess ;) It can be upgraded with certain
    color crystals like the Atlantean Boomerang.  I never once used this feature
    but you can mess around with it if you like.  A chart below tells what color
    crystals will affect the compass.
