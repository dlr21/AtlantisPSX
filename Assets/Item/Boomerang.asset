  description: This item is also acquired in Level 1 in the giant fish tank.  It
    is the primary weapon of Milo and can be upgraded using certain color crystals
    that are found throughout the entire game.  To use a crystal on the boomerang
    you must combine the two.  Combining an already upgraded boomerang will not have
    a greater effect than if it wasn't upgraded.  A chart below tells what color
    crystals will affect the boomerang.
